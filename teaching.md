##  Current courses (2022-2025)

####  MKTG 6201:  Marketing Management

In Spring B and Summer B terms, I teach the  required graduate-level marketing course in the Professional MBA (PMBA) and One-Year MBA programs. In the past I have also taught this course to MS in Management students.

##  Past courses

####  MAST 6252: Customer Analytics using Probability Models

This was a required course taught in the MS in Business Analytics (MSBA) program.

####  MAST 6201: Managerial Statistics

The required first-year statistics course for full-time MBA,  professional PMBA (PMBA), and MS in Management (MSM) students.


## Research graduate students and post-docs

The Cox School of Business does not have a doctoral program.  If you are not currently a doctoral student at SMU or elsewhere, you should know that I have no admission slots to offer, or any way to fund your studies.

I am interested in working on research projects with talented graduate students, both at SMU and elsewhere.  If you believe our interests overlap, please consult with your advisor in your home department or university to see if it makes sense to have a conversation.  I am available to serve on dissertation committees for SMU students, or students at other universities whose advisors I know (or know of).

The Cox School **does** have the ability to hire post-doctoral fellows.  If you have received, or are about to receive, your Ph.D. in a discipline related to my research, please send me a CV and short proposal of what you would like to work on at SMU.
