### Doctoral students, research graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows



The Cox School of Business does not have a doctoral program.  If you are not currently a doctoral student at SMU or elsewhere, you should know that I have no admission slots to offer, or any way to fund your studies.

I am interested in working on research projects with talented graduate students.  If you believe our interests overlap, please consult with your advisor in your home department or university to see if it makes sense to have a conversation.  I
am available to serve on dissertation committees for SMU students, or students at other universities whose advisors I know (or know of).

The Cox School **does** have the ability to hire post-doctoral fellows.  If you have received, or are about to receive, your Ph.D. in a discipline related to my research, please send me a CV and short proposal of what you would like to work on at SMU.
