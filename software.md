I am the author of four packages for the R statistical programming language.  I also have a library of code snippets for R, emacs, and LaTeX that I will post from time to time, as I clean them up for public review.

## R packages

- [trustOptim](https://cran.r-project.org/package=trustOptim)

- [sparseHessianFD](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sparseHessianFD)

- [sparseMVN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sparseMVN)

- bayesGDS (not currently maintained)

## emacs

I use Aquamacs Emacs
