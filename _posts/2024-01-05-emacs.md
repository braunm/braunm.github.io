 I write _everything_ in Emacs: code, reviews, manuscripts, lecture slides, and even recommendation letters.

 Specifically, I use [Aquamacs Emacs](http://aquamacs.org){:xn}, an emacs port for MacOS.  GNU Emacs has been around since 1985, so it is just plain __solid__, with a huge user base for support, and thousands of packages and modes that can do anything from syntax highlighting of your favorite programming language (`ess-r-mode`) to psychotherapy (`doctor`).  By using the same program for ever a fully-featured platform, I can use the same program (and thus, the same keybindings) for everything I do.

Emacs is easy to use.  **Configuring** Emacs can be hard.  Someday I will post my configuration file, which has evolved quite a bit over the last decade.
