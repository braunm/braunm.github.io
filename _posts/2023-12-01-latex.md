I write my research papers directly in Emacs, marked up with [LaTeX](www.latex-project.org){:xn}. The [AuCTeX](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/){:xn} Emacs package provides lots of time-saving functions, macros, and keymaps that have become so automatic to me that I can just focus on the writing.

  - I compile my LaTeX documents with [LuaTeX](www.luatex.org){:xn} (instead of pdfTeX) for a few reasons:
	- With [fontspec]({{page.texdoc}}fontspec){:xn} and [unicode-math]({{page.texdoc}}unicode-math){:xn}, I can create documents using any installed font, rather than being limited to fonts provided in LaTeX packages.
	- Sometimes there is a need to run calculations as part of the document, such as when drawing figures using [TikZ]({{page.texdoc}}tikz){:xn}.
	- Some LaTeX packages require LuaTeX.  An example is lua-check-hyphen, which generates a list of all hyphenated words in the document, so I can confirm that they are hyphenated at the right places.
   - The [preview-latex](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/preview-latex.htmlpackage){:xn} (now included in AuCTeX) embeds compiled chunks of rendered LaTeX (e.g., math symbols and equations) directly in the emacs frame. That way I can see the all of the content -- text and math -- together in the same frame I am writing in, without having to glance to the output pdf.
   - Reference management:  I use [biber]({{page.texdoc}}biber){:xn} (http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net){:xn} and  [biblatex]({{page.texdoc}}biblatex){:xn}  to insert citations and create bibliographies. Biblatex is designed to be more flexible and customizable than bibtex,  but my references are stored in bibtex format. My bibtex database (which I maintain using [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io){:xn} contains 1,800 references (and in most cases, pdfs) of academic papers I have downloaded, read, intend to read, intended to read, or otherwise needed for some reason, collected since I was a graduate student. I write _everything_ in Emacs: code, reviews, manuscripts, lecture slides, and even recommendation letters.  Specifically, I use [Aquamacs Emacs](http://aquamacs.org){:xn}, an emacs port for MacOS.  GNU Emacs has been around since 1985, so it is just plain __solid__, with a huge user base for support, and thousands of packages and modes that can do anything from syntax highlighting of your favorite programming language (`ess-r-mode`) to psychotherapy (`doctor`).  By using the same program for ever a fully-featured platform, I can use the same program (and thus, the same keybindings) for everything I do.
