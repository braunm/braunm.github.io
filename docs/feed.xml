<p>Many online advertising platforms provide tools to help researchers conduct experiments on the relative effectiveness of ads.  But  platforms target different users to different ads, based on the content of those ads.  This creates a confound that makes it impossible to separate the effect of the ad from the effect from how an online platform’s targeting algorithm decides which users see those ads. As a result,  which of the platform’s users are included in the experiment, and how experimental subjects are selected to be exposed to each treatment, are <strong>not randomized</strong>.</p>

<p>Our paper lays out this problem from the perspective of academic researchers who may be considering conducting field experiments using these tools.  We want these researchers to understand the trade-offs between the convenience of only A-B testing and the threats to internal validity that result from ad targeting.  In this paper, we provide a set of guidelines for researchers (and editors) to follow when determining whether certain online experimental designs are appropriate, and how much weight should be placed on the resulting inferences.</p>

Publisher Preprint Where A-B Testing Goes Wrong: How Divergent Delivery Affects What Online Experiments Cannot (and Can) Tell You About How Customers Respond to Advertising with Eric Schwartz 2024: Working paper Abstract Marketers use online advertising platforms to compare user responses to different ad content. However, platforms’ experimentation tools deliver ads to distinct, optimized, undetectable mixes of users that vary across ads, even during the test. As a result, the estimated A-B comparison from the data reflects the combination of ad content and algorithmic selection of users, which is different than what would have occurred under random exposure. We empirically demonstrate this “divergent delivery” pattern using data from an A-B test that we ran on a major ad platform.

  <li>I compile my LaTeX documents with <a href="www.luatex.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">LuaTeX</a> (instead of pdfTeX) for a few reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>With <a href="https://texdoc.org/pkg/fontspec" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">fontspec</a> and <a href="https://texdoc.org/pkg/unicode-math" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">unicode-math</a>, I can create documents using any installed font, rather than being limited to fonts provided in LaTeX packages.</li>
      <li>Sometimes there is a need to run calculations as part of the document, such as when drawing figures using <a href="https://texdoc.org/pkg/tikz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">TikZ</a>.</li>
      <li>Some LaTeX packages require LuaTeX.  An example is lua-check-hyphen, which generates a list of all hyphenated words in the document, so I can confirm that they are hyphenated at the right places.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/preview-latex.htmlpackage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">preview-latex</a> (now included in AuCTeX) embeds compiled chunks of rendered LaTeX (e.g., math symbols and equations) directly in the emacs frame. That way I can see the all of the content – text and math – together in the same frame I am writing in, without having to glance to the output pdf.</li>
  <li>Reference management:  I use <a href="https://texdoc.org/pkg/biber" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">biber</a> (http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net){:xn} and  <a href="https://texdoc.org/pkg/biblatex" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">biblatex</a>  to insert citations and create bibliographies.
