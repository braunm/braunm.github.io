Schwartz 2024: Journal of Consumer Research Abstract Digital advertising platforms have emerged as a widely utilized data source in consumer research; yet, the interpretation of such data remains a source of confusion for many researchers. This article aims to address this issue by offering a comprehensive and accessible review of four prominent data collection methods proposed in the marketing literature: informal studies, multiple-ad studies without holdout, single-ad studies with holdout, and multiple-ad studies with holdout. By outlining the strengths and limitations of each method, we aim to enhance understanding regarding the inferences that can and cannot be drawn from the collected data. Furthermore, we present seven recommendations to effectively leverage these tools for programmatic consumer research. These recommendations provide guidance on how to use these tools to obtain causal and non-causal evidence for the effects of marketing interventions, and the associated psychological processes, in a digital environment regulated by targeting algorithms. We also give recommendations for how to describe the testing tools and the data they generate and urge platforms to be more transparent on how these tools work. Publisher Preprint Where A-B Testing Goes Wrong: How Divergent Delivery Affects What Online Experiments Cannot (and Can) Tell You About How Customers Respond to Advertising with Eric Schwartz 2024: Accepted at Journal of Marketing Abstract Marketers use online advertising platforms to compare user responses to different ad content. But platforms’ experimentation tools deliver different ads to distinct and undetectably optimized mixes of users that vary across ads, even during the test. Because exposure to ads in the test is non-random, the estimated comparisons confound the effect of the ad content with the effect of algorithmic targeting. This means experimenters may not be learning what they think they are learning from ad A-B tests. The authors document these “divergent delivery” patterns during an online experiment for the first time. They explain how algorithmic targeting, user heterogeneity, and data aggregation conspire to confound the magnitude, and even the sign, of ad A-B test results. Analytically, the paper extends the potential outcomes model of causal inference to treat random assignment of ads and user exposure to ads as separate experimental design elements. Managerially, the authors explain why platforms lack incentives to allow experimenters to untangle the effects of ad content from proprietary algorithmic selection of users when running A-B tests. Given that experimenters have diverse reasons for comparing user responses to ads, the authors offer tailored prescriptive guidance to experimenters based on their specific goals.

<a href="https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/puntoni/" target="_blank">Stefano Puntoni</a>  (Wharton),  <a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eric-schwartz" target="_blank">Eric Schwartz</a> (Michigan), and I explain why experiments using digital advertising platforms are likely not answering the question you are asking.</p>

<p>Many online advertising platforms provide tools to help researchers conduct experiments on the relative effectiveness of ads.  But  platforms target different users to different ads, based on the content of those ads.  This creates a confound that makes it impossible to separate the effect of the ad from the effect from how an online platform’s targeting algorithm decides which users see those ads. As a result,  which of the platform’s users are included in the experiment, and how experimental subjects are selected to be exposed to each treatment, are <strong>not randomized</strong>.</p>

<p>Our paper lays out this problem from the perspective of academic researchers who may be considering conducting field experiments using these tools.  We want these researchers to understand the trade-offs between the convenience of only A-B testing and the threats to internal validity that result from ad targeting.  In this paper, we provide a set of guidelines for researchers (and editors) to follow when determining whether certain online experimental designs are appropriate, and how much weight should be placed on the resulting inferences.</p>

<p>Eric and I also have  a <a class="link-primary" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#BraunSchwartz2024Modal"> complementary paper </a>  that goes into some quantitative  detail about how   <em>divergent delivery</em> of different ads to different users generates bias in A-B test results. This paper takes the perspective of the practicing marketer who uses A-B test results to make strategic decisions based on which creative elements of ads are most effective.</p>
